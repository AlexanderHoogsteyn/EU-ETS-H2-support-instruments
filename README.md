This code was developed to study the interaction between the power sector, the energy intensive industry and the hydrogen sector on the auctions of the European Emission Trading System, the energy-only electricity market, the hydrogen market. It calculates an equilibrium between a set of representative price-taking agents on these markets and allows enforcing renewable targets and different defnitions of the "additionality" principle (putting requirements on the electricity used in the electrolysis proces). It allows to enforce hydrogen and renewable energy targets. An auctioned fixed premium and hydrogen contract for difference can be applied. It employs an iterative price-search algorithm based on ADMM to calculate this equilibrium iteratively.  The emissions of the energy-intensive industry are represented via marginal abatement cost curves, which can be automatically calibrated to reproduce allowance prices post MSR reform (2019).

The research code is forked from the framework used in the following paper, and uses an identical representation of the power sector and ETS-sector than considered there:

The research code documented below has been used in the following paper, where the adaptations form the original paper are pointed out:

## Installation, hardware & software requirements
### Installation
After downloading the repository, no specific installation is required. The user should, however, have the following software installed to be able to execute the program:
- Julia (https://julialang.org/downloads/)
- Gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com/) and have a license for this solver. If the user doesn't have access to Gurobi, any alternative (open source) solver capable of solving quadratic programming problems can be used. 

The program can be executed in the Julia terminal. Any text editor can be used to modify the code. However, it may be more convenient to work with a tool such as Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If the user does not have any of these programs installed, the installation should take approximately one hour.

### Software requirements: 
This code has been developed using Julia v1.5 and is verified to be compatible up to v1.7.2 . The solver used is Gurobi v.9.0.

The following Julia packages are required:
- JuMP v.0.21.5
- Gurobi v.0.8.1
- DataFrames v.0.21.7
- CSV v.0.7.7
- YAML v0.4.2
- DataStructures
- ProgressBars v0.7.1
- Printf
- TimerOutputs
- JLD2
- ArgParse
- RepresentativePeriodsFinder (https://ucm.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/representativeperiodsfinder.jl/)

If the user does not have any of these programs installed, the installation should take less than one hour.

### Hardware requirements 
No specific hardware is required. Depending on the configuration (number of agents and markets considered), computational effort may significantly increase.

## Running the program
### Input
There are three places where the user can change the input.

2. The specifications of each scenario can be found in the file "overview_scenarios.csv"
    - scen_number: Represents the scenario number or identifier.
    - MSR: "YES" or "NO", Choose to consider the MSR 2021-2023 based on 2018 rules, 2024 - end based on 2023 rules or not conider the MSR at all.
    - RES_target_2030: Set the renewable energy source (RES) target for 2030, e.g. 0.45 for 45%.
    - H2_demand_2030: Total hydrogen demand for 2030 (Mt).
    - H2_demand_2050: Total hydrogen demand for 2050 (Mt).
    - CNH2_demand_2030: Auctioned hydrogen volume in 2030.
    - gamma: Order of the marginal abatement curve (1=linear cost curve, 2=linear MAC, 3=quadratic MAC)
    - max_em_change: Maximum allowable change in emissions per iteration (used to improve numeric stability)
    - Additionality_pre_2030: "NA", "Daily", "Monthly", "Yearly". Can be used to imposse of RFNBO additionality rules before 2030.
    - Additionality_post_2030: "NA", "Daily", "Monthly", "Yearly". Can be used to imposse  of RFNBO additionality rules after 2030.
    - H2_balance: "Daily", "Monthly", "Yearly". Choose how the balance of hydrogen supply and demand is imposed.
    - import: "YES", "NO". Choose to consider import of carbon-neutral hydrogen.
    - H2FP_tender_2030: "YES", "NO". Select FP policy mechanism 
    - H2CfD_tender_2030: "YES", "NO". Select hydrogen Contracts for Difference (H2CfD) policy mechanism
    - H2_cap_grant: "YES", "NO".  Select capacity grant policy mechanism.
    - H2_cap_tax_reduct: "YES", "NO". Select investment subsidy policy mechanism.
    - fix_generation: "YES", "NO". Impose that hydrogen generation needs to be kept fixed during the years under the contract.
    - max_support_duration: e.g. 8760. Set a maximum yearly duration of government support.
    - ref_scen_number: Reference scenario number applicable to this scenario.
    - Sens_analysis: "YES", "NO". Turn sensetivity analysis on for this scenario
    - hot_start: Use a hot start; initialize the prices in the model based of a previous model run.
    - Comments: Additional comments or notes related to the scenario.
3. The file "overview_data.yaml" contains a number of input parameters that are common to all scenarios. Examples include the number of years the analysis considers, the historical emissions and prices that will be used to calibrate the marginal abatement cost curve and the parameters of the market stability reserve for each of the two designs. Note that the impact of COVID (240 MtCO2, linearly decreasing between 2020-2025) can only be switched on/off (see above).

### Running the code (to be updated)
The code can be run by executing the "MAIN.jl"file, there are different ways to select which scenarios to run.

1. On line 167 of the "Main.jl"-file, the user can specify the set of scenarios one would like to study, ranging from "start_scen" to "stop_scen". This determines which scenarios in the "overview_scenarios.csv"-file will be executed. Similarly,  the user can select a set of sensitivities using "start_sens" and "stop_sens" as defined in "overview_sensitivity.csv" To use this option, make sure to set "HPC" on line 7 to "NA".
2. Alternatively, the scenario and sensitivity instructions can be parsed as arguments from the command line. To use this option, make sure to set "HPC" on line 7 to "DelftBlue". For example, the following line executes scenario 1 to 10 in the central reference sensitivity:
```
julia --threads=16 MAIN.jl --start_scen 1 --stop_scen 10 --start_sens 1  --stop_sens 1 > output.log
```

If the scenario at hand is a scenario in which the marginal abatement cost needs to be calibrated, the ADMM procedure will be executed a number of times until the emission allowance price in 2019 is replicated with a user-specified tolerance (default: 80 EUR/tCO2 with a 0.1 â‚¬/MWh tolerance, see "overview_data.yaml"). The code will report (in the terminal) the progress of the ADMM procedure and the difference between the computed emission allowance price in 2019 and the historical value. Only the final result (i.e., based on the calibrated MACC) will be stored. Similarly, if you decide to include hydrogen import, the import cost will be calibrated such that a user-defined amount of import is present in 2030 (default: 10 Mt H2 in 2030 with a 0.1 Mt tolerance, see "overview_data.yaml").

If the scenario at hand can use a calibrated marginal abatement cost curve from the specified reference scenario (see above), the ADMM procedure is executed once. When the user desides to alter the cost information in "overview_data.yaml" it is important that such a recalibration is carried out, otherwise, the current cost calibration of the MAC and import cost curve can be used.

```
Tips: 
- Adapt the script so that it points to the direction where "MAIN.jl" can be found
- The decision problems of the agents are solved in parallel in each iteration. Gurobi uses 4 threads to solve each problem.
- The number of cpus should be equal to the number of agents + 1 (1 master and 1 per agent)
- Set the number of cpu's equal to the number of threads used for julia x 4 (e.g., 17 x 4 = 68), as by default 4 threads are used by Gurobi
- Check resource use via seff [job_id]
